					<p>When the band Journey was filling stadiums in the ’80s singing about &ldquo;a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit…&rdquo; they probably weren’t referring to Monik Sanghvi. But, any geography buff knows that &ldquo;south Detroit&rdquo; is actually Windsor, Canada – and, by being born and raised there, Monik lays claim to those lyrics.</p>

					<p>The son of an auto industry family, Monik was brought up in a car buff household where ever-present magazines like Automotive News, Car &amp; Driver and Road &amp; Track ignited his passion for the automotive industry. Living in and around Detroit through the late 70’s and ‘80s galvanized his purpose to help put Detroit back on the map.</p>

					<p>So after graduating from the University of Michigan and Harvard Business School, Monik brought his talents back to Detroit. Serving clients at firms like McKinsey &amp; Company, Organic, AOL and Digitas helped build Monik’s expertise in strategic planning, CRM and digital marketing. This foundation is critical to his current mission at Team Detroit.</p>

					<p>As the Chief Digital and Integration Officer, Monik is charged with leading the agency’s digital marketing services as well as its continual evolution as an industry-leading, fully integrated marketing communications firm. It may be a tall task, but one that Monik embraces with the zeal of a man focused on helping Detroit to thrive once again.</p>

					<p>Monik lives in suburban Detroit with his wife and two children. He reminds his kids of that Journey song all the time &mdash; after all, it is entitled &ldquo;Don’t Stop Believing.&rdquo;</p>
