					<p>In a sense, Mike is the most senior trainee at Team Detroit. Technically, we don’t hand out an office, a nice parking spot and those types of perks to traditional trainees, but Mike says that because he learns something new everyday, he still qualifies as one. It’s that curious nature which has helped him rise to become Team Detroit’s Chief Strategy Officer.</p>

					<p>Once in the strategy field, Mike has worked on brands including Sega, BT, Orange, Carling Black Label, Kronenbourg1664, The Scottish Office, Quaker Oats, Sugar Puffs, The Labour Party, Cadbury’s and a number of car brands, including Cadillac. It was there that he helped re-launch the brand with its successful “Break Through” campaign.

					<p>Mike is married with one daughter. He won’t say if they call it “soccer” or “football”.</p>
