				<p>Andy is the numbers guy. The kind of person who scoffs at the TurboTax programs of the world. The kind of person who was always on the edge of his seat during Economics classes. The kind of person most people envied and admired in school. Which is exactly the type of person you want running the financial department of such a large and diverse organization like Team Detroit.</p>

				<p>Andy is responsible for the financial management of Team Detroit and was instrumental in the establishment of Team Detroit as a single business unit. In addition to Finance, Andy is responsible for the IT, Facilities and Quality Functions.</p>

				<p>Prior to joining the ad agency world, Andy was the Accounting Director, Marketing and Sales at Ford. He also worked in various consulting roles at Coopers and Lybrand, and began his career at Ernst &amp; Young.</p>

				<p>Andy holds an MBA in Finance and Management from Columbia Business School and an undergraduate degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo. He is a Certified Public Accountant (aka The anti-TurboTax).</p>

				<p>Aside from spending time with his wife and four kids, Andy serves on several nonprofit boards – focused on education and overall community welfare – throughout the community.</p>
