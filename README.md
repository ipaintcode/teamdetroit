Changed the steam to the wdet | alpha channel (it total rocks and has that old school house electro Detroit sound)

#### TODO (2015):

A list of some very outstanding bugs from back in the day, promised one day I would fix. As usual it was GO-GO-GO get'r done, OMG LAUNCH NOW, so the hack-tast-ic madness happened.

1. Fix the nasty function.js/function_.js hackery double trouble...
2. Fix the nasty css files like the function dynamic duo.
3. Make responsive, this was a personal request but would like to get it working RWD!
4. Remove all the jQuery animate's in return for CSS3 transitions and keyframes.
5. Add in Grunt, for concat, min, ugly, sass, livereload and a few other easy to manage Grunt hotness.
6. Streamline templates with hbs, no crazy mv* stuff just modernizing and optimizing.
7. Remove most of the jQuery plugins as they're not needed anymore after a rebuild.
8. Add a proper fix for streaming audio.
