#  HTML5 Reset (http://html5reset.org)

## Summary:

HTML5 Reset is a simple set of best practices to get web projects off on the right foot.

1. A style sheet designed to strip initial files from browsers, meaning you start off with a blank slate.
2. Easy to customize -- remove whatever you don't need, keep what you do.
3. Analytics and jQuery snippets in place
4. Meta tags ready for population
5. Empty mobile and print style sheets, including blocks for device orientation
6. Modernizr.js [http://www.modernizr.com/](http://www.modernizr.com/) enables HTML5 compatibility with IE (and a dozen other great features)
7. IE-specific classes for simple CSS-targeting
8. iPhone/iPad/iTouch icon snippets
9. Lots of other keen stuff...
10. 

#  TODO:

A list of some outstanding bugs from back in the day, promised one day I would fix.

1. Fix the nasty function.js/function_.js hackery double trouble...
2. Fix the nasty css files like the function dynamic duo.
3. Make responsive, this was a personal request but would like to get it working RWD!
4. Remove all the jQuery animate's in return for CSS3 transitions and keyframes.
5. Add in Grunt, for concat, min, ugly, sass, livereload and a few other easy to manage Grunt hotness.
6. Streamline templates with hbs, no crazy mv* stuff just modernizing and optimizing.
7. Remove most of the jQuery plugins as they're not needed anymore after a rebuild.
8. Add a proper fix for streaming audio.
