				<p>Toby began his career at Hal Riney &amp; Partners in San Francisco working on the Saturn car account. Over nine years, he produced more than 56 commercials for the little car from Spring Hill. He also worked on Stroh’s beer, Mirage Resorts, and created one of the first commercial websites for a little brewery in Montana called Black Star.</p>

				<p>After that, Toby moved to New York where he served as Creative Director at TBWA/Chiat Day working on Barnes &amp; Noble, ABC, Absolut Vodka, New York Life and Seagram’s Brands.</p>

				<p>Toby joined JWT New York in early 2003 overseeing work on accounts as varied as HSBC, De Beers, Kimberly Clark and the Sundance Channel.</p>

				<p>In 2006, Toby co-created and creative-directed the Bold Moves documentary, which captured Ford beginning its transition at a critical time. Intrigued by what he saw as a culture of change, Toby agreed to move to Detroit and become a part of Ford’s turnaround.</p>

				<p>In the past two years, Toby has been nominated for a Webby, been included in Communication Arts’ interactive annual, their design annual and their advertising annual. He has also won three One Show Pencils and a Cannes Lion. His favorite piece of advertising was the one that got him written up in the National Enquirer. But that’s a long story.</p>
